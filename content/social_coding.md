## Sharing papers and academic credit

<img src="../img/sharing-papers-upright.jpg" style="width: 80%;"/>

- We want maximum visibility and maximum reuse.
- The more interesting science is done referencing my paper, the better for me.

```{discussion} Discussion
- Come up with **reasons for sharing** your scripts/code/data
- Also think about **reasons for not sharing**
- Why is software often treated differently from papers
```

## What are the benefits of sharing software?

- Easier to find and reproduce (**scientific reproducibility**)
- More trustworthy: others can verify correctness and find and report bugs
- Enables others to build on top of your code (derivative work, **provided the license allows it**)
- Others can submit features/improvements
- Others can fix bugs
- Many tools and apps are free for open source
  ([GitHub](https://github.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org),
  [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com), [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org))
- Good for your CV: you can show what you have built
- Discourages competitors. If others can't build on your work, they will make competing work

## Sharing is scary

- Fear of being scooped
> A license can avoid it. Anyway, it is very unlikely that others will understand your code and publish before you without involving you in a collaboration. Sharing is a form of publishing.
- Exposes possibly "ugly code"
> In practice almost nobody will judge the quality of your code.
- Others may find bugs
> Isn't this good? Would you not like to use a code which gives people the chance to locate bugs?
- Others may require support and ask too many questions
> This can become a problem: use tools and community and protect your time.
- Fear of losing control over the direction of the project
> Open source does not mean everybody can change **your version**.
- "Bad" derivative projects may appear
> It will be clear which is the official version.

## Sharing code

> "I did all the ground work and they get to do the interesting science?"

- Sharing code and encouraging .emph[derivative work] may boost your academic impact.

## Journal policy as motivation for sharing

[From Science editorial policy:](https://www.sciencemag.org/authors/science-journals-editorial-policies)
> "We require that all computer code used for modeling and/or data analysis
> that is not commercially available be deposited in a publicly accessible
> repository upon publication. In rare exceptional cases where security
> concerns or competing commercial interests pose a conflict, code-sharing
> arrangements that still facilitate reproduction of the work should be
> discussed with your Editor no later than the revision stage."

 [From Nature editorial policy:](https://www.nature.com/authors/policies/availability.html)
> "An inherent principle of publication is that others should be able to
> replicate and build upon the authors' published claims. A condition of
> publication in a Nature Research journal is that authors are required to make
> materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available to readers
> without undue qualifications. Any restrictions on the availability of
> materials or information must be disclosed to the editors at the time of
> submission. Any restrictions must also be disclosed in the submitted
> manuscript."

However a study showed that despite these policies, many people still do not share their code ðŸ˜ž : [https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2584](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2584). This paper includes samples of charming author responses such as
> "When you approach a PI for the source codes and raw data, you better explain
> who you are, whom you work for, why you need the data and what you are going
> to do with it."

## Social coding

- Whether you can share your output depends on how you obtained your input.
- .emph[Software licenses] matter.
- Sometimes "OTHERS" are you yourself in the future in a different group/job.

## Motivation for open source software

- Enable derivative work
- Do not lock yourself out of own code
- Attract developers who want to be able to show the coding work on their CVs
- Tightly regulated domains require open source
- OSS can lead to more engagement from industry which may lead to more impact
- If it's not open, it is not likely to become standard

## Code reuse

Should you reuse things that others have done?

Types of things that can be reused:
- Main libraries (e.g. numpy, scipy)
- Special scientific libs
- Random code from website
- Copying from Stack Overflow

Do you want others to reuse what you make?

How do you turn your own small project into the next numpy? Do you want to?

## What contributes to reuse?

What contributes to you being able to reuse stuff that others make, and others (or you) being able to reuse your stuff?

```{discussion} Discussion

As a **developer** or user what are you looking at when discovering a new package?

```

```{solution} These are common things to check:

- Date of last code change ... is the project abandoned?
- Release history ... how about stability and backwards-compatibility?
- Versioning ... will it be painful to upgrade?
- Number of open pull requests and issues - are they followed-up?
- Installation instructions ... will it be difficult to get it running?
- Example ... will it be difficult to get started?
- License ... am I allowed to use it?
- Contribution guide ... how to contribute and decision process?
- Trust and community ... somebody you trust recommended it?
```

## This is what we teach in [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org):

- Version control including project management
- Testing
- Documentation
- Reproducibility
- Code citations
- Being findable
- Licensing



```{keypoints}
- Share your software, if you can
- Reuse other peoples software
```
